# tmux
My tmux configuration
- git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/polytr/tmux.git   inside .config
- run tmux, enter the config file.
- The green bar should en on top at this point, if not quit tmux and enter again.
- Press CRTL-w and then I. NOT AT THE SAME TIME
- The should be a sceen saying the packages are being installed, then the green bar is replaced by its aesthetic counterpart.
- Should be all, if you want the nvim integration to work you have to add the plugin on nvim's side as well, the config in this account has a repo with the module
